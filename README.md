### 📑 Additional Readings
> The value of k is very crucial in the KNN algorithm to define the number of neighbors in the algorithm. The value of k in the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm should be chosen based on the input data.

> Cross-validation methods can help in selecting the best k value for the given dataset.
